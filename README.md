# google-apps-scripts
  
This is a list of all scripts I've come up with to easy some process.

## interview-solution

this script aims at filtering out correct answers, which are placed between 2 tags `{solution}` & `{end}` in a doc file.  
In addition to that, a button is created when opening up the questionnaire. By pressing it it will start the process and will eventually generate a pdf file containing only the questions aimed at the candidate.
